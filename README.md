Word training
========================

This application helps to remember foreign language words. All words in the application are divided into dictionaries.
The person with admin privileges is allowed to access admin panel and create/edit/delete dictionaries.
Dictionary can be filled with words manually, specifying word's spelling, transcription, translation and pronounce audio.
There are several ways to specify pronounce: type url to audio file, choose audio via file browsing dialog,
record audio on microphone or select AUTO option. When adding word to the dictionary, only spelling attribute is
required, others can be loaded automatically via configured loaders. Besides, list of words with spelling can be imported from
text file or from text, pasted in the appropriate dialog.
In the public area we start by choosing one of the available dictionaries and go to the page with all words
in the dictionary. After browsing words and learning them, we can strengthen our knowing by doing several exercises.
There are two types of exercises: choosing right answer from available ones or typing answer.
Words, which will be used in the exercise depends on the selected package. Packages are divided on local and global
packages. Local ones can include words from the current dictionary only. Global packages can include words from all
available packages. Initially, for each user, including unauthorized, there are only two preset packages available:
"current dictionary words" and "all dictionaries words". They can not be modified. Additionally, there is an option
for creating own package to the authorized users.
